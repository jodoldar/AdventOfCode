# Advent of Code - 2021
Advent of Code repository for the 2021 edition

##  Current status:
- **Day 1**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 -> Line by line file processing and parsing.
    - Part 2 -> Usage of a `vector` to find the triplets.

 - **Day 2**: Done with JavaScript (Node.js) :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Used `readline` module for a line-by-line processing.

 - **Day 3**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Usage of `accumulate` to simulate fold operations.

 - **Day 4**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Usage of a class to manage each of the _bingo_ cardboards.

 - **Day 5**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Usage of a class to manage the map. Result of Part 2 with an image for fun.

 - **Day 6**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 -> Simple simulation of each individual.
    - Part 2 -> Instead of individual management, uses like a 8-state machine to store how many elements have an specific state.

 - **Day 7**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 -> Usage of `nth_element` to obtain the median.
    - Part 2 -> Usage of `accumulate` to help with the average of the positions.

 - **Day 8**: Done with JavaScript & C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 -> Done with JavaScript, like _Day 2_.
    - Part 2 -> Done with C++. Hardcoded step-by-step process to decode the alphabet for each line.

<br/>

 - **Day 9**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Usage of classes to manage the _basis_ changes.

<br/>

 - **Day 10**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 -> Usage of `stack` container to manage the lines (not recursive).
    - Part 2 -> Same as Part 1 and reusing the _middle_ functionality of Day 7.

 - **Day 11**: Done with C++ :heavy_check_mark:
    - Part 1 & 2 -> Mix of the Day 9 and Day 6 behaviour.
